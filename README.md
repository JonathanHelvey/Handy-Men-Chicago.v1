  Starter for Gatsby Theme Musician
</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

This starter creates a new Gatsby site that is preconfigured to work with [gatsby-theme-musician](https://github.com/ekafyi/gatsby-theme-musician/), a theme for bands and music artists ðŸŽ¸ðŸŽ™. 

A *theme* is something you add to your Gatsby site, which you can combine with other themes (learn more in their [official docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/what-are-gatsby-themes/)). If you already have a Gatsby site, you can [add the theme manually](https://github.com/ekafyi/gatsby-theme-musician#option-b-manually-add-to-your-existing-site); this starter site aims to get you started quickly if you want to create a new site.

ðŸ’¡ _If you have never used Gatsby before, head to their [quick start guide](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/quick-start/) or [beginner-friendly tutorials](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/)._

## Quick start

```sh
# create a new site at the directory "my-band-site"
gatsby new my-band-site https://github.com/ekafyi/starter-musician-theme

# go to the site directory
cd my-band-site

# start your site
gatsby develop
```

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!
